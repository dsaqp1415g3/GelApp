#GelApp Android Application 

Import the project with Android Studio, connect your device and send the project or look for the *.apk file and install it. You may have to consider to change the base URL to which the app connects, which is defined in the config.properties file inside the assets folder. It has to have the IP address, the port where to listen (8080 usually for Tomcat, or your configuration) and /GelApp.
